# Statistics and R

## Project Overview
For this project, I applied my understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. All of the analysis and visualizations were written in the R programming language.

## Resources
- **Data Sources**: `MechaCar_mpg.csv` & `Suspension_Coil.csv`
- **Software and Tools**: R, RStudio & Git Bash

## Challenge Deliverables and Results

### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

I designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the `MechaCar_mpg.csv` dataset. The multiple linear regression results help to answer the following 3 questions:

### **1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

### **2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

### **3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

### Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

I created a summary statistic table with the `Suspension_Coils.csv` dataset to answer the following question:

### **1. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?**

### Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils

I performed t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pound per square inch. In summary, the t-test results show that:

### Deliverable 4: Study Design - MechaCar vs. Competition

I designed a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
